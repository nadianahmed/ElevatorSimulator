# Elevator Simulator

Elevator Simulator is a simulation tool for controlling elevators in a building. It is designed to handle multiple elevators and floors, and is still under development. Once complete, it will have a GUI and will allow users to simulate elevator movements, arrivals, and departures.

The simulator is designed to control various components of each elevator, including the doors, buttons, arrival sensor, motor, and direction lamp. It will also control the direction lamp, floor lamp, and floor button of each floor. By simulating the behavior of these components, the Elevator Simulator will allow users to test and optimize their elevator systems without having to physically build and test the elevators themselves.

## Usage

As the simulator is still under development, usage instructions will be determined once the development is complete. The tool will be easy to use, and will allow users to create and control multiple elevators and floors.

## Examples

Examples of how to use the Elevator Simulator will be provided once the development is complete. The examples will include scenarios such as controlling the elevators to transport passengers between floors, managing elevator traffic during peak hours, and optimizing elevator routes to reduce waiting times for passengers.

## Contribution Guidelines

The contribution guidelines are still under development, but will include instructions on how other developers can contribute to the project. This may include reporting issues, submitting pull requests, or contributing code.

## License

There is currently no license for this project. Once development is complete, we will determine the appropriate license and update this README file accordingly.
